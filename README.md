# awesome-codepen
a list of wonderful Codepen pens, inspiring you to create amazing apps and games UI

This is my first project related to UI/UX design where I select attractive, useful or just inspirational (in my opinion!) UI / UX solutions, and publish them on GitHub

I don't pretend to be objective at all. just my vision.

Discord server for suggestions, questions or just chatting on a UI / UX topic:

Please note:
the authorship of the pens may not be verified properly.
If you find an error related to authorship of a pen, please report it to the project Discord channel, or create a GitHub issue.
